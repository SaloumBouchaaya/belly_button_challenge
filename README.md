# belly_button_challenge

##In this challenge I built an interactive dashboard that explores the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset. I created a bar and bubble chart that displays each sample from the dataset. There is an interactive data set that will change the charts accordingly. 

##The data is provided by edX bootcamp U.C Berkeley
